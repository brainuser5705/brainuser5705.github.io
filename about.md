### Some quick facts:

### Blog:

Read my blog [(currently on Medium)](https://medium.com/@serviceuser5705)! I 
tend to have a lot of thoughts and like to document them. I plan to start many 
new projects as I continue through life and write down my progress and what I 
learn on my blog. Maybe it's more of a brain-dump than a blog...cause I'm
