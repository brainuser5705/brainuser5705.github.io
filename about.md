### Some quick facts:
- Computer science major at Rochester Institute of Technology
- From Brooklyn, NYC
- Working on [running list of projects](http://simp.ly/p/b9b4LV) and hobbies 
to try
- Current projects/hobbies: improving technical knowledge and abilities (DS&A,
frontend web development), studying Korean, figuring out how to live life

### Blog:

Read my blog [(currently on Medium)](https://medium.com/@serviceuser5705)! I 
tend to think too much about too many things for too long and then document what
new "insights" I gained. Also life updates, documentation for my projects and 
learning experiences. If you're into technical tutorials or philosophical life 
ramblings, you might find something interesting to read.
