I've been learning on and off now for about a year. Did some Billy Go videos - learned Hangul, basic phrases, vocab and grammar. Then stopped to take a more independent approach with Anki + ChatGPT. Then stopped completely. Then did some periodic readings of TTMIK's Korean reading books. In my most recent "consistent" block, I have been:
- doing 3-5 new words on Anki
    - currently separated words by verbs and nouns
    - cards have informal conjugation (ìš”), sample sentences paired with pictures, pronunciation
- reading through a webtoon
    - copying the sentences and asking ChatGPT to explain the grammar
- watching videos sometimes

I've started reading **Fluent Forever** by Gabriel Wyner and it has some great tips about how to make the most of your language learning. Some things I will start doing once I have more time:
- revamp my Anki cards
    - reduce the number of sentences
    - make sure I have some personal connection to it
    - fix the layout
    - establish a good schedule for making Anki cards
- IPA for Korean
