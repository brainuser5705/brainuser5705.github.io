## 23 - Fluent Forever and IPA!

Spent basically the entire day learning how to decipher IPA symbols. I think I got the basics down for consonants and vowels in terms of how the charts work. It's pretty awesome how linguists were able to compile all of this, but holy cow did they go ham. Just the amount of terminology and possible combinations and categories is mind-boggling.

- Consonants: voiced, place (what passive/active articulators are touching what), manner (how is the sound made)
- Vowels: height, rounded, front/back

Found a lot of resources, the ones that helped me the most:
- [IPA chart for knowing how to pronounce the symbols](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/IPAcharts/inter_chart_2018/IPA_2018.html)
- [actual Korean phonetics](https://hangul.fun/)

Still need to practice (with actual words) but now that I understand how they actually work physically, it's a lot easier to make the sound instead of imitating by ear. Which I think is a big win.

Next is to repeat it a bunch of times until it's ingrained in my memory. I also found an Anki deck of minimal pairs so that'll help my listening more to. But it is in practice (aka the real world) that will truly test me...

> A bit of an aside...my very first introduction to Hangul was this [comic](https://www.ryanestrada.com/learntoreadkoreanin15minutes/). It is great for visual mnemonics but eventually I ended equating the English pronunication of the letters to Hangul. It also doesn't explain the difference between regular, aspirated and tense consonants that well, which I think is the hardest part about Korean phonetics for English speakers. So for newcomers, definitely use it in the beginning but once you got it down, switch over to IPA.

I've been learning on and off now for about a year. Did some Billy Go videos - learned Hangul, basic phrases, vocab and grammar. Then stopped to take a more independent approach with Anki + ChatGPT. Then stopped completely. Then did some periodic readings of TTMIK's Korean reading books. In my most recent "consistent" block, I have been:
- [ ] doing 3-5 new words on Anki
    - [ ] currently separated words by verbs and nouns
    - [ ] cards have informal conjugation (ìš”), sample sentences paired with pictures, pronunciation
- [ ] reading through a webtoon
    - [ ] copying the sentences and asking ChatGPT to explain the grammar
- [ ] watching videos sometimes

I've started reading **Fluent Forever** by Gabriel Wyner and it has some great tips about how to make the most of your language learning. Some things I will start doing once I have more time:
- [ ] revamp my Anki cards
    - [ ] reduce the number of sentences
    - [ ] make sure I have some personal connection to it
    - [ ] fix the layout
    - [ ] establish a good schedule for making Anki cards
- [ ] IPA for Korean
